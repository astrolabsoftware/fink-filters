    """Return a relatively complete stream of transient alerts.

    Notes
    -----
    Should keep good quality transients,
    and remove a significant part of the contamination.

    Parameters
    ----------
    faint: Pandas series of bool
        Is currently fainter than 19.8,
        or the source had a very recent detection fainter than 19.
    positivesubtraction: Pandas series
        Is brighter than the template image.
    real: Pandas series of bool
        Is likely a genuine astrophysical transient and not an artifact.
    pointunderneath: Pandas series of bool
        Is likely sitting on top of or blended with a star in Pan-STARRS.
    brightstar: Pandas series of bool
        Is likely contaminated by a nearby bright star.
    variablesource: Pandas series of bool
        Is likely a variable star
    stationary: Pandas series of bool
        Is not a moving source.
    roid: Pandas series
        Is an asteroid.

    Returns
    -------
