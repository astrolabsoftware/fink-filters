    """Return alerts considered as microlensing candidates

    Parameters
    ----------
    mulens: Pandas series
        Probability of an event to be a microlensing event from LIA.
        The number is the mean of the per-band probabilities, and it is
        non-zero only for events favoured as microlensing by both bands.

    Returns
    -------
    out: pandas.Series of bool
        Return a Pandas DataFrame with the appropriate flag:
        false for bad alert, and true for good alert.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> pdf = pd.read_parquet('datatest/regular')
    >>> classification = microlensing_candidates_(pdf['mulens'])
    >>> print(pdf[classification]['objectId'].to_numpy())
